# QA Flask Final Project

This project started as a way for me to practice flask while on the QA Cloud course and since starting i have deceded to use it as part of my final project.

## The Project

This Flask app is designed to :

    - Allow user to access the user dashboard and update password or delete account.
    - Allow Admin to access an admin dashboard so they can give users diferent access rights to content or remove a user. 

The user should not be able to access the admin dashboard.
